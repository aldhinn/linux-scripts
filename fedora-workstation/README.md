These are the scripts I use for setting up a Fedora Worsktation instance.

## ðŸ¦« Sequence
I typically use these scripts like this.

After installation, I run:
``` bash
./lean
```
to create a lean install. After that, I'll run
``` bash
./update
```
I would restart. Then finally, I either run,
``` bash
./setup/desktop
```
or
``` bash
./setup/dev-vm-desktop
```
depending on what I wanted to setup.
